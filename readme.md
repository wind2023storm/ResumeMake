Simply choose a template, fill in as much (or as little) info as you want, and then press <kbd>Make</kbd> to see your output. You can change your template at any point to see how your resume looks with different designs.

When you're happy with your result, you can download the resume as a PDF, TeX, or JSON document. The JSON output is compatible with [JSONResume](https://jsonresume.org).
